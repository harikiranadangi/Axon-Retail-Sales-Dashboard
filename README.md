# Axon Retail Sales Dashboard

# Problem Statement:
Axon, a small retailer specializing in classic cars, is encountering challenges in managing and analyzing their sales data effectively. Their sales team struggles to interpret the data due to its complexity, leading to difficulties in making informed decisions. Additionally, the lack of a centralized system further exacerbates the problem, as the management faces delays in obtaining accurate and up-to-date sales reports, impacting their decision-making process. To address these issues, Axon has decided to implement a Business Intelligence (BI) solution.

# Abstract:
This project, titled "Business Intelligence Solution for Sales Data Management and Analysis," aims to help Axon overcome the challenges associated with managing and analyzing their sales data. By leveraging Microsoft Power BI and SQL, the project intends to provide Axon with a robust BI solution tailored to their needs. The key objectives of this project include:

1. Extracting, cleaning, and integrating sales data from a MySQL database into Power BI.
2. Designing interactive dashboards and reports using Power BI to provide insights to the sales team and management.
3. Utilizing SQL for advanced analytics to extract valuable insights that can enhance sales strategies.
4. Enabling real-time access to dashboards and reports to facilitate data-driven decision-making.
5. Ensuring the solution is user-friendly and enhances sales data management and analysis processes.

The project workflow involves creating a MySQL database named "classicmodels," extracting, cleaning, and loading data into Power BI, designing visualization and analysis tools, testing, debugging, and deploying the solution. Additionally, user training and comprehensive documentation are crucial components of the deployment phase.

By achieving these objectives, this project aims to provide Axon with a powerful BI solution that improves their decision-making processes and overall business performance, enabling them to thrive in the competitive classic car retail industry.
